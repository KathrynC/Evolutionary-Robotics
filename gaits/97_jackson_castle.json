  "description": "Castle: only two synapses active \u2014 w13=-0.9 and w24=0.9 (diagonal connections). Each leg speaks only to its own motor through the body. No community, no cross-talk, no village. We have always lived in the castle. Two isolated pathways produce whatever motion isolation permits."
