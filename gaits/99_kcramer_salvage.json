  "description": "Salvage Path: starts from panopticon-like symmetry (all \u00b10.5, which produces near-paralysis at 2m) but adds asymmetric cross-wiring (w34=0.35, w43=-0.25) to break the deadlock. The editorial intervention that rescues a failed text \u2014 one structural addition that transforms stasis into motion."
