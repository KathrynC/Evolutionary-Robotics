  "description": "Lottery: curie base (the village's normal walk) with one weight drawn for destruction \u2014 w14 flipped from +0.3 to -1.0. One synapse is chosen, one stone is thrown. Compare to dick_replicant (which flipped w14 to -0.26); this goes further \u2014 maximum negative weight. The lottery always ends badly for someone."
