  "description": "The Yurchenko double pike: near-maximal sensor drive (0.95 uniform) with strong cross-wiring (0.6) but no self-feedback. Pure explosive coordination \u2014 the vault that changed gymnastics. Every synapse at competition intensity, the cross-wiring providing the rotational coupling that makes the double pike possible."
