  "description": "Hill House: the base pattern looks like sayama (a stable walker), but the self-feedback has the wrong sign (w33=-0.6, w44=+0.6 \u2014 reversed from the stabilizing w33>0/w44<0 pattern). The house looks right from outside. The angles are not quite right inside. Whatever walks there, walks alone."
