  "description": "A Chorus Line: every sensor-motor weight is identical magnitude (0.7) \u2014 the ensemble moves as one. The cross-wiring (w34=0.3, w43=-0.3) is the choreographer's coordination, ensuring the line stays together. Every dancer does the same steps. The singular sensation of uniform commitment."
