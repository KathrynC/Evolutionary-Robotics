  "description": "Hoo-ah!: maximum intensity across the board. All sensor-motor weights at 0.9, cross-wiring at 0.5, self-feedback at 0.4. The Scent of a Woman tango \u2014 every synapse firing at near-maximum, the full Pacino. When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose. The question is whether this much passion produces motion or chaos."
