  "description": "Transactional: the offer wave (motor 3, driven by strong negative weights) propagates forward in time; the confirmation wave (motor 4, driven by positive weights) propagates backward. The cross-wiring (w34=0.5, w43=-0.5) is the handshake \u2014 the transaction that creates the observable event of locomotion."
