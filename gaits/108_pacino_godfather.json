  "description": "Godfather: quiet authority. Moderate weights that don't shout but command \u2014 the Don speaks softly. Cross-wiring and self-feedback at low levels create internal deliberation. The offer you can't refuse is made at conversational volume. Every weight below 0.65, yet the network produces directed motion through controlled asymmetry."
