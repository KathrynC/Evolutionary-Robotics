  "description": "The twisties: when the body's internal model inverts. Weak sensor drive (0.2 uniform) \u2014 the proprioceptive signal fades. Self-feedback signs are REVERSED (w33=-0.7, w44=+0.7) \u2014 the motors' self-model is wrong. Like jackson_hill_house, the internal geometry is inverted. The bravest thing she ever did was stop."
