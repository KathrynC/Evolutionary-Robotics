  "description": "Shakespeare in the Park: the classical curie pattern (the most reliable forward walker) performed outdoors with ambient noise \u2014 tiny cross-wiring (w34=\u00b10.1, w33/w44=\u00b10.05) represents the wind, the traffic, the audience coughing. The text is timeless; the performance is alive. Compare to dick_valis which adds similar noise."
