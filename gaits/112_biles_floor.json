Asymmetric sensor weights create the musical phrasing \u2014 strong w13/w04 for the tumbling passes, moderate w23/w14 for the dance elements. Cross-wiring (0.4) provides rotational awareness, light self-feedback (0.2) sustains the performance. The gait that shows mastery is not maximum force but maximum control.",
