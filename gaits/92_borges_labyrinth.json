  "description": "Labyrinth: sensor-motor connections are faint whispers (0.1-0.3) while cross-wiring dominates (w34=0.7, w43=-0.9). No direct path from input to output \u2014 every signal must route through the maze. The labyrinth has no center; the motors speak to each other more than they listen to the sensors."
