## Overview

Trial 3 emerged from the 500-trial random search as the most efficient gait found — 1.73x more efficient than the CPG Champion (gait 43), the previous efficiency leader. It achieves this with a standard 6-synapse network, no hidden layer, no optimization. Pure chance.

## The Efficiency Secret: It's Slow and Lazy

Trial 3 uses 30% of the energy for 52% of the distance. The 1.73x efficiency advantage comes not from a better walking strategy but from a lower-energy one. It found a gait that barely participates in its own locomotion.

### Energy Breakdown by Joint

| Joint | Trial 3 | CPG Champion | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| BackLeg (j0) | 1,309 | 3,506 | 0.37x |
| FrontLeg (j1) | 648 | 2,976 | 0.22x |
| **Total** | **1,956** | **6,482** | **0.30x** |

Trial 3 is essentially a one-legged walker. The back leg does 2x the work of the front leg. The front leg coasts, contributing only 22% of what the CPG Champion's front leg spends. This asymmetry is the core of its efficiency — it doesn't waste energy on symmetric actuation.

## The Anti-CPG: Reactive vs Generative Control

The CPG Champion oscillates its joints at 2.4–2.2 Hz — fast, metronomic, internally generated by a hidden-layer half-center oscillator. It drives the body hard, extracting maximum displacement through resonant forcing.

Trial 3's joints oscillate at 0.24 Hz and 0.42 Hz — roughly 10x slower. There is no internal clock. The controller is purely reactive: sensors detect ground contact, motor neurons respond with small corrections, and the body's natural rocking dynamics do the rest.

The CPG Champion is an engineered gait: a hidden-layer oscillator that discovered the body's resonant frequency and drives it hard. Trial 3 is an accidental gait: a simple reactive controller that happens to be gentle enough to let the body's natural dynamics carry it forward.

## Weight Structure

```
Sensor 0 (Torso):    w03=-0.597  w04=-0.424  sum=-1.021  diff=-0.174
Sensor 1 (BackLeg):  w13=+0.112  w14=-0.005  sum=+0.108  diff=+0.117
Sensor 2 (FrontLeg): w23=+0.297  w24=+0.214  sum=+0.511  diff=+0.083

Total drive to BackLeg motor (m3): -0.188
Total drive to FrontLeg motor (m4): -0.214
Ratio m3/m4: 0.88
```

### Interpretation

- **Torso sensor dominates**: Both w03 and w04 are strongly negative (-0.60, -0.42). When the torso is in contact with the ground (sensor fires), both motors receive inhibitory drive, pulling the legs back. This is a protective reflex: "if I'm falling, retract."
- **Leg sensors are weak**: The back and front leg sensors provide gentle excitatory feedback (w13=+0.11, w23=+0.30) to the back leg motor, and near-zero or weak drive to the front leg motor (w14≈0, w24=+0.21).
- **Nearly balanced total drive**: Both motors receive similar total inhibition (m3=-0.188, m4=-0.214). This produces a gentle, roughly symmetric rocking motion.

The net effect: the robot falls forward, the torso sensor fires (if torso touches), both motors pull back slightly, the robot rocks, the legs touch down, weak excitation nudges the back leg, and the cycle repeats at the body's natural frequency. No forced oscillation. No fight against physics.

## Phase Dynamics

The phase portrait (joint 0 vs joint 1) shows Trial 3 traces a loose, drifting orbit — not the tight, stable ellipse of the CPG Champion. Phase lock is moderate (0.60 vs 0.64). The joints are not tightly coordinated; they drift in a loosely productive pattern.

The delta phi (mean phase difference) is -0.08 rad — the joints are nearly in-phase, meaning both legs move in roughly the same direction at the same time. The CPG Champion's delta phi is -2.73 rad — the legs are nearly in anti-phase (alternating), which is the classic walking gait.

Trial 3 doesn't walk in the classical sense. It shuffles — both legs move together, the body rocks, and forward progress comes from the asymmetric ground contact pattern rather than alternating leg strokes.

## Contact Pattern

- Torso never touches the ground (duty = 0.000) — the robot stays upright
- Back leg touches 21.7% of the time
- Front leg touches only 6.9% of the time — it's mostly airborne

The front leg's low ground contact explains its low energy expenditure: it spends most of the simulation not touching the ground and therefore not generating reaction forces. The back leg bears the locomotion burden.

## The FFT Tells the Story

Trial 3's FFT spectrum (fig 7) shows broad, low-frequency energy with a peak at 0.24 Hz for the back leg and 0.42 Hz for the front leg. There is no sharp spectral peak — the oscillation is not periodic in the way the CPG Champion's 2.4 Hz spike is. Trial 3's motion is quasi-periodic, driven by contact events rather than an internal clock.

The CPG Champion's spectrum shows a clean, dominant peak at ~2.4 Hz with harmonics — the signature of a limit-cycle oscillator. The two gaits occupy fundamentally different regions of the dynamical landscape: one is a driven oscillator, the other is a passive rocker.

## The Philosophical Point

The CPG Champion is the robot that learned to make its own clock and drive itself at resonance. Trial 3 is the robot that learned to do almost nothing and let physics carry it.

This is embodied cognition made concrete. Sometimes the best controller is the one that does the least. The body has natural dynamics — rocking frequencies, contact patterns, passive energy return from gravity. A controller that discovers these and gently nudges them forward (rather than overriding them with a forced rhythm) can achieve superior efficiency at the cost of speed.

The tradeoff is real: Trial 3 covers half the distance in the same time. But per unit of energy, it goes 73% farther. If the optimization target were "distance per joule" rather than "distance," Trial 3 would be the champion.

## Research Implications

1. **Seed for hill climbing**: Trial 3's weights are a strong starting point for optimization targeting the speed-efficiency Pareto frontier. A hill climber starting here might find a gait that retains the efficiency advantage while increasing speed.

2. **The lazy controller hypothesis**: The finding suggests a general principle — for minimal-actuator systems, the most efficient control strategy may be one that exploits passive body dynamics rather than actively driving them. This connects to the passive dynamic walking literature (McGeer 1990, Collins et al. 2005) where walkers with no motors at all achieve locomotion through gravity and mechanical design.

3. **6-synapse vs hidden-layer ceiling**: Trial 3 demonstrates that 6-synapse networks can find high-efficiency gaits that the CPG Champion's hidden-layer architecture does not. The two architectures may be exploring different regions of the efficiency-speed frontier. A systematic comparison of 6-synapse vs hidden-layer Pareto frontiers would clarify whether the hidden layer is necessary for high-speed locomotion but counterproductive for high-efficiency locomotion.

4. **The near-zero w14**: The weight from BackLeg sensor to FrontLeg motor is essentially zero (-0.005). This means the front leg is almost completely decoupled from back leg contact feedback. The front leg is driven only by the torso and its own sensor. This decoupling may be key to the efficiency — it prevents the front leg from wasting energy reacting to back leg events.
